    ***** About This Project *****

    This project was completed as part of the course requirements for CAPP 30122 
    in March 2021 by James Midkiff, Onel Abreu, Syeda Jaisha, and Domingo Carbone. 

    Main project components: 
    - Game Recommendation system: This recommends up to five boardgames that match 
        a user's preferences, sorting by mean user rating or by popularity. 

    - Regression Prediction system:  This predicts the mean user rating 
        and popularity for a hypothetical boardgame given the user's description. 

    - Web scraping and API testing application:  This tests the code used for 
        scraping web data and pulling API data from BoardGameGeek. 
    
    The game recommendation and regression predictions systems use a dataset 
    of the 5000 boardgames with the most number of ratings on the BoardGameGeek 
    website as of March 12, 2021. Game expansions were removed from the dataset. 

    The testing application allows the user to run the web scraping and the 
    API data scripts for a specified number of boardgames and visit the 
    corresponding exported files. In the interest of project stability, these 
    files are NOT used in the Game Recommendation or Regression Prediction systems; 
    their purpose is to allow the user to see how the data was obtained. 

    Project component authors: 
    - Game Recommendation system:  Domingo Carbone
    - Regression Prediction system:  Syeda Jaisha
    - Django/User-Interface:  Onel Abreu
    - API Data Extraction:  James Midkiff
    - Additional Web Scraping:  Onel Abreu
    - Project component linking:  James Midkiff
    
    All data and images come from the BoardGameGeek site, located at 
    boardgamegeek.com

    Thank you for exploring our application, and play more boardgames!
